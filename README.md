# Exploring a dataset on medical appointments and attendance

This was an introduction to python and the bread and butter libraries, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib/seaborn. The purpose was to explore a dataset and wrangle, clean, and apply any feature engineering where needed.  Then visualization was conducted to look for any insights into attendance rates for medical appointments in Brazil. Some of the questions I tried to answer were the following:

	1) Check to see if any morbidites influenced missing appointments
	
	2) Check to see if any age groups/genders miss appointments more often
	
	3) Check to see if days or prone to having missed appointments
	
	4) Check to see if a threshold exists from scheduled date to appointment date

This project was a part of the Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree.
