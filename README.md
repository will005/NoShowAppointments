# NoShowAppointments
The Investigate a Dataset Project
Udacity Data Analysis Project

Dataset chosen: No-show appointments

Questions: 
	1) Check to see if any morbidites influenced missing appointments
	2) Check to see if any age groups/genders miss appointments more often
	3) Check to see if days or prone to having missed appointments
	4) Check to see if a threshold exists from scheduled date to appointment date

Using datframes, I grouped data in specific ways and made plots to visually see any patters/trends
